# Live Streaming with Amazon Interactive Video Service



# Use Case

The AWS Community in India has grown massively over the past years. We now span across 25 cities in 20 states, and we have hosted hundreds of virtual, in-person and hybrid events. Running the developer community such as AWS User Group India involves a lot of efforts from organisers and volunteers to host events and drive initiatives that benefits the larger community. Live streaming the events cannot be ignored. We increasingly rely on the internet to deliver what we want and need, and we want it delivered quickly, reliably and on demand.

Creating a high-quality live streaming experience from scratch is very difficult. Sounds easy enough. If you want, you can create  a EC2 instance, update the operating system, install open source media server software, open firewalls and virtual network ports, start streaming, and put it in function in a day. But what if someone joins the stream from the other side of the world? What if your stream is really popular and thousands of people want to see it? Ready to manage autoscalers and load balancers and OS updates/patching/maintenance? This is where Amazon IVS comes in play which can be used to power interactive live video streaming applications.
